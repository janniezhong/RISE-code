README for today's lab:

- Drag the model_templates folder to your desktop before using.
- For NEURON or NEURON+Python models, follow the instructions in 
the Word Doc "Compiling NEURON mechanisms" before running the model
- When opening model scripts in Spyder, you can use Spyder to look at/edit the 
scripts and then use another Anaconda program to execute the simulations so that they don't crash the 2nd time. For example, if we want to run a script
 called network_run.py in the SadehClopathRopper2015 model folder, we have two options:


* Anaconda prompt: 
cd desktop\model_templates\SadehClopathRopper2015
python network_run.py


* QtConsole: 
cd desktop\model_templates\SadehClopathRopper2015
run network_run.py




Check out some of these model templates and examples:

* BahlEtAl2012 - 5 different pyramidal cell models in NEURON+Python

* ballandsticknetwork - basic network of connected cells in NEURON+Python

* GC-gna_distribution - small simulation in Jupyter Notebook, mostly for example

* Hipp_paper_code - CA1 network model with 5 cell types, memory encoding and recall, NEURON+Python

* HybridModelMatlab - Grid cell coding in 1D and 2D, in MATLAB

* izhikevich_simple_nrn - example Izhikevich-style neurons in NEURON+Python

* NNBackProp - example artificial neural network in Jupyter notebook

* OBGAMMA - Olfactory bulb gamma oscillations in NEURON+Python (but takes a long time to run!)

* SadehClopathRotter2015 - network with synaptic plasticity in Python



Towards the end of the day, one partner in each team should send an email to Dr. Bezaire at mbezaire@bu.edu if there is something particular 
you want help with for creating a model script or editing an existing script.  Please let me know if:

- You want to find a different model template to work with for your project (any specifics that you have in mind are helpful)

- You want to use the ball-and-stick or CA1 model templates, but you want different cell types in them or different synapses (let me know what 
cell types or synapses you are interested in)

- You want to use Dynasim, but are not sure what equations to use for your cells or ion channels or synapses, or you need help creating a netcon matrix 
that specifies how your cells are connected



If you have general concerns or if you know what template you want to use and are starting to make plans for it, you can also email me to let 
me know!
